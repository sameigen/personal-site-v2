## Hello!

Hi! My name is Sam - I specialize in full-stack Software Engineering, Offensive and Defensive Security, and large-scale Serverless Automation. I graduated from Tulane University in 2020 with a double major in Computer Science and Political Economy. I have worked in Cybersecurity, first level Incident Response, and automating both the big and small away in the Education and MSSP spaces.

Some passions outside of the security space include making Linux / open source projects accessible to all, machine learning, blockchain technology, and using non-traditional programming languages to spearhead projects that they aren't "designed to do" :)

I thrive in team-orientated innovative spaces, quickly iterative processes, and teams where everyone is willing to learn just one more thing.

## Languages + Personal Grade of Expertise

Here is quick list of some of the programming languages / scripting methods / libraries I've used throughout my career as well as my completely unbiased grade of expertise:
- Python (Expert)
- Bash (Expert)
- JavaScript (Expert)
- TypeScript (Advanced) 
- C (Advanced)
- Java (Advanced)
- Rust (Advanced)
- React (Advanced)
- Swift (Advanced)
- Electron (Intermediate)
- Solidity (Intermediate)

## Cloud Technologies I've Used and How!

## AWS
**Lambda**:
- Deployed serverless code to automate the onboarding of 150,000 devices of Columbia University students and faculty to the Malwarebytes platform
- Employed Lambda for a personalized "down-detector" - if any on-prem or cloud-based service didn't respond to a ping, we would be the first to know about it
	
**S3**:
- Employed S3 with pen-tested IAM policies to use as storage for cold SIEM logs for retention purposes

**RDS**:
- Used RDS to create a custom Threat Intelligence feed with 3 tables for IP addresses, hash values, and domains with a confidence score. This had a UI frontend as well. 

**DynamoDB**:
- Used a NoSQL database in an iterative startup for user data (who knows what else may need to be added? NoSQL is great!) 
- Used Python Boto3 libraries to programatically pull this data upon authenticated API request

**EC2**:
- Created hundreds of EC2 instances for sandbox, development, and production machines
- Used Application and Network Load Balancers depending on the use case
- Employed multiple custom AMI templates to mass-deploy machines to given VPCs

**Interaction**:
- Personally have used the AWS-CLI, Python's boto3 library, and the Node.js AWS package to interact with all of the above programmatically

## GCP 
**Security Center**: 
- Automated alarms being sent out to customers and partners under the GCP security center

**Monitoring**:
- Used GCP's API to iterate over all projects, clusters, and containers to scan for vulnerabilities

**CI/CD**:
- Employed GCP's CI/CD model in personal projects for testing a streamlined deployment to production in quickly iterative processes

## Azure
**Security Center**: 
- Automated alarms being sent out to customers and partners under the Azure security hub

**Virtual Machines**:
- Built Azure Compute/VMs both personally and professionally for testing new tools, penetration testing, and delivering solutions end-to-end
